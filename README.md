# ðŸŽ¯ Project Update Notice

Hey there ðŸ‘‹  

Just a quick heads-up!  
The **latest code** and all the cool new features are currently being developed on the **`testing`** branch ðŸ§ª.  

The **`main`** branch only holds the **refined version** â€” the one thatâ€™s been fully tested and confirmed to work smoothly.  

Once everything on `testing` is bug-free and fully functional, itâ€™ll be merged right back into `main` ðŸš€  . 
Feel free to checkout the testing branch if you want to checkout the latest code, play around with it or evenly possibly help resolve the issues!
